# Flight-Management-System
This C++ program is a Flight Reservation System that allows users to book, cancel, and view flight tickets using an object-oriented approach. It features multiple classes, including flightManagementSystem for managing flights, bookingInfo for ticket booking, PassengerDetails for storing user details, and PaymentDetails for handling transactions via debit cards, credit cards, or net banking. The system generates a PNR number upon booking and provides a confirmation. Users can also cancel tickets by entering their PNR number. The main() function offers a menu-driven interface, allowing users to interact with the system easily. However, the program lacks data persistence, meaning all bookings are lost once it exits. Additionally, it could be improved with better error handling, input validation, and database integration instead of using multiple if-else statements. Despite these limitations, the program effectively demonstrates OOP principles and serves as a good starting point for a more advanced flight booking system.
